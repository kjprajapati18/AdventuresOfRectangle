# AdventuresOfRectangle

This project is simply a learning experience for me and was not intended to become a fully-developed game.

Things that I have learned:
1. Basic JFrame, Canvas, JPanel, and JComponents
2. Threads
3. LinkedLists and ArrayLists
4. Abstract Classes and Enums
5. Adding images and drawing to screen
6. Graphics, BufferStrategy, and Graphics2D
7. KeyAdapter, MouseAdapter and ActionListener
8. Collision Detection
9. Changing Game states
10. Adding sounds (in progress)
